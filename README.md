# Bestsellers

Welcome to the Bestsellers CLI App/Gem! The app lets you explore this week's bestselling books by pulling data from the New York Times Books API.
You can view the categories included on the bestsellers list, the top 5 books from each category, and the details about each book.
Check back regularly to find your next good read.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bestsellers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bestsellers

## Usage

To launch the program, type
```ruby
$ ruby bin/bestsellers
```
into your terminal

Executing the program will take you directly to the full list of categories on the New York Times Bestseller List.
From there, follow the prompts to see the top 5 books in a specific category, and to get all the details on a specific book.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
